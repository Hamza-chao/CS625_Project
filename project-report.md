## Exploring Environmental Trends: Air Quality and Commuting Patterns Across States
### I) Datasets: 
For this project, I utilized four distinct datasets:

1. Air Pollution Dataset: This dataset, available at [Data Society](https://data.world/data-society/us-air-pollution-data), provides comprehensive information on air pollution across the United States.

2. Commute Mode Dataset: The dataset, sourced from the [Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)](https://www.bts.gov/browse-statistical-products-and-data/state-transportation-statistics/commute-mode), offers insights into commuting patterns and modes of transportation used by residents.

3. Population Datasets: Population data spanning from 2000 to 2016 were obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau's [Population Estimates Program](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/), facilitating demographic analysis.

4. State Codes Dataset: This dataset, retrieved from [OpenDataSoft](https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/georef-united-states-of-america-state/export/?flg=en-us&disjunctive.ste_code&disjunctive.ste_name&sort=year), provides information on state codes necessary for geographical mapping and analysis.
